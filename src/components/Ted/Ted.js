                            <p>In the spirit of TED’s mission, ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a brand of self-organized events that create TED-like experiences to share with the community.
                            A TEDx event is a local, self-organized one, where x refers to an independently organized TED event. It aims to engage the audience by combining TED talk videos and live speakers to spark deep discussion and connection. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are independently organized (subject to certain rules and regulations).
